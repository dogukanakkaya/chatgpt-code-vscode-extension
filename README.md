# ChatGPT Code

This extension helps you to use ChatGPT in Visual Studio Code

**:warning: Since the API that this project uses is unofficial, you might face 403 or 429 HTTP errors and maybe future breaks if OpenAI change things. Also some features/fixes of newer versions of the API module requires Node.js >=18 but latest VSCode version runs Electron with Node 16 and it cannot be changed. A workaround may written but I see that unnecessary since there is no official API (https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/issues/137). Maybe I'll reimplement this later when official API is out (or be lazy enough not to)**

### Refactor Selection

## Todo [On Hold]

- [x] Add refactor selection command
- [ ] Stream the response instead of waiting for it to be finished
- [ ] Generate wait texts as placeholders instead of inserting comment lines to file
- [ ] Analyze selected code and explain (why it's broken etc.)
- [ ] Add create test for function command
- [ ] Run multiple `@chat` comments in parallel
- [ ] Ability to create conversation and change the generated responses
- [ ] Write test
